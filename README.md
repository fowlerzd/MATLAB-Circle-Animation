# Circle Animation
Displays an animation of increasing numbers of dots spinning in a circle.

The number of dots spinning at once goes from 1-7 while maintaining equal spacing detween the dots.
Additionally, the colors of the dots will cycle through n colors, where n is the number of dots.

This is mostly an exercise in using trigonometery concepts and vectorized code to create an animation.
